iris-squid-vm provides a Vacuum model VM definition which runs a Squid
HTTP cache suitable for use with VMs started by Vcycle which use CernVM-FS. 

A vacuum pipe with this definition is provided at 
    https://repo.iris.ac.uk/squid-vm/iris-squid.pipe

Since CernVM itself relies on CernVM-FS, it is not suitable as the image
for the Squid VMs. Instead a generic CentOS 7 image should be used in
the vacuum_pipe section of the Vcycle configuration:

[vacuum_pipe SPACENAME squid]
root_image = image:CentOS7-1907
backoff_seconds = 3600
vacuum_pipe_url = https://repo.iris.ac.uk/squid-vm/iris-squid.pipe
https_x509dn = /CN=example
user_data_file_hostcert = hostcert.pem
user_data_file_hostkey = hostkey.pem
flavor_names = ONEorTWOprocessorFLAVOR
processors_limit = 2
target_share = 1

If squid is the pipe name then the VMs will be created with machinetype
squid-vm. This machinetype can be used in other vacuum pipe and machinetype
sections with the option:

cvmfs_proxy_machinetype = squid-vm

This tells Vcycle to give the list of currently running Squid VMs to the
worker VMs created by the other sections. See the vcycle.conf for more
details.

The Squid VMs send a heartbeat to Vcycle every 5 minutes if the Squid
server passes a basic functionality test (fetching http://cern.ch). Squid VMs
which are sending heartbeats comprise the list of VMs whose IP addresses
will be given to worker VMs for use with CernVM-FS.
